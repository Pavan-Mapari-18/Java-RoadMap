-------------------------------------  As a Microservices developer----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please learn:

1. Microservices Architecture Basics: Monolithic vs. Microservices, characteristics (independence, scalability, resilience), and designing microservices boundaries (DDD - Domain-Driven Design).

2. Service Communication: Synchronous (REST, gRPC) vs. Asynchronous (Message Queues), API design and versioning, event-driven architecture, and event sourcing.

3. Data Management: Database per service, distributed data management (saga pattern, 2PC, CQRS), and handling data consistency across services.

4. Deployment Strategies: Containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and service discovery and registry (Eureka, Consul).

5. Frameworks and Tools: Spring Boot (Spring Cloud for microservices), Micronaut, Quarkus, or Dropwizard as alternatives.

6. Communication Protocols: RESTful APIs and gRPC, messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

7. Databases: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra), and distributed caching (Redis, Memcached).

8. CI/CD Pipelines: Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and deployment strategies like Blue-Green and Canary deployments.

9. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible, or AWS CloudFormation.

10. Logging and Monitoring: Centralized logging (ELK Stack, Splunk) and monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).

11. Resilience and Fault Tolerance: Circuit Breaker (Hystrix, Resilience4j), Bulkhead pattern, and retries.

12. Security: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and API Gateways (Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong).

13. Testing Microservices: Unit and integration testing, contract testing (Pact), and end-to-end testing.

14. Scalability Patterns: Horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing (HAProxy, NGINX).

15. Distributed Tracing: Tools like Jaeger and Zipkin.

16. Anti-Patterns: Avoiding distributed monoliths and over-engineering microservices.
