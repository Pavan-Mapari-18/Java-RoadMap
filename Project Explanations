**"I worked on a Transport & Logistics domain project for United Parcel Service (UPS) focusing on real-time parcel tracking and route optimization. The goal was to improve delivery efficiency and customer tracking accuracy.

On the backend, I used Java 8, Spring Boot, and MySQL, developing REST APIs for parcel tracking, shipment updates, and performance reporting. I optimized SQL queries and added caching, reducing API latency by 25%.

One key challenge was handling a high volume of tracking data without slowing down performance. I solved this by implementing indexing, pagination, and database connection pooling.

As a result, delivery delays reduced by 15% and tracking accuracy improved to 99%, directly boosting operational efficiency."**

During peak times, when a massive volume of tracking data was coming in, I ensured the system handled high demand smoothly by optimizing APIs, queries, and implementing caching. I also worked closely on resolving customer-reported issues in real time, ensuring minimal delivery disruptions.

Role:
Java Backend Developer (Transport & Logistics Domain – UPS)

Responsibilities:

    Developed and maintained REST APIs using Java 8 and Spring Boot for parcel tracking, shipment updates, and reporting.

    Handled peak-time high data loads by optimizing queries, enabling caching, and implementing pagination for better performance.

    Worked on real-time issue resolution by analyzing customer-reported problems and delivering quick fixes to avoid delivery delays.

    Integrated with MySQL database, wrote complex queries, created indexes, and optimized stored procedures for faster data retrieval.

    Collaborated with the QA and front-end teams to ensure smooth feature delivery and bug resolution.

    Monitored application logs, performed debugging, and fixed production issues under tight deadlines.

    Participated in daily scrum meetings and contributed to sprint planning, task estimation, and code reviews.

Challenges Faced:

    High Traffic During Peak Hours

        Problem: During festive seasons and sales, the system had to handle a sudden spike in tracking requests, causing API slowness.

        Solution: Implemented caching (Redis), pagination, and SQL indexing, which reduced response time by 25% and prevented downtime.

    Real-Time Issue Resolution

        Problem: Customer-reported issues like wrong status updates or delayed tracking had to be fixed quickly without affecting live operations.

        Solution: Set up log monitoring and quick debugging scripts, allowing faster root cause analysis and hotfix deployment.

    Database Performance Bottlenecks

        Problem: Large tables with millions of records were slowing down queries.

        Solution: Optimized queries, added composite indexes, and used read-replica databases to balance load.

    System Integration with External APIs

        Problem: UPS system needed to sync with third-party logistics partners’ APIs, which had inconsistent response formats.

        Solution: Created a data transformation layer to standardize incoming data before processing.

    Ensuring Data Accuracy in Tracking

        Problem: Some shipments were showing outdated locations due to delayed updates.

        Solution: Implemented asynchronous data processing using message queues to process updates in near real-time.
